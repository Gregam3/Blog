# Money 
For a long time I have been trying to get to the bottom of what drives me, my life has taken a somewhat unexpected turn for the better by societal standards.
When I was younger I was fairly overweight and I decided that I would lose weight, all of a sudden I seemed to have this immense motivation to 
achieve anything within my reach, with a lot of effort but nethertheless I would get there in the end. I used this new ability of mine to strive 
towards what I thought I wanted, at the time I was unfortunately something of a teenage libertarian, so what I thought I wanted was money. I work hard
through my first years of university and my strategy keeps working, I recieve great results and feel very validated. And then the opportunity to pursue internships came up, great another chance to be validated, I then decide to continue pursuing what I thought was what would make me happy money, all of this was subconscious of course. 

I end of picking some very prestigious (in my mind) companies and end up recieving my internship at one of them, the pay here was very substancial for just an internship and I was as happy as could be. But something strange happened, it seemed as though I did not actually care at all about the money. I was not using it and I continued to live my previous standard of life pretty much, a few more restaraunt outings but overall not much really changed. I then realised I cared much more about the number of what I was being paid than the actual money itself. The salary number felt great, I was earning more than of the "real adults" in my life and I felt very powerful. I didn't really put too much thought into.

# Respect
Some years later I started more serious introspection, I realised that the reason I had been pursuing a high salary was because of the high status that comes with it, I wanted status. More specifically I wanted respect, because I didn't really feel the desire to have power. Honestly at this point despite my additional effort I ran into a wall, I couldn't figure why I wanted to be respected but I did figure out some other things over a few years.
* I think about my goals in terms of narratives of sharing them with people, i.e. if I were to run a marathon what motivates me is the idea of talking to people about having ran a marathon. (Despite wanting to talk about something like this I would never force it into a conversation, it would always need to arrive naturally).
