## The philosophy behind the hypotheticals
If you're already familiar with moral anti-realism & Kant's categorical imperative please skip ahead, one of my worst nightmares is mansplaining philosophy.

### Moral anti-realism
Moral anti-realism is the belief that objective morality does not exist, nothing is objectively good or objectively evil. Even things society regards as abhorrent such 
as mass murder, are not wrong or evil objectively in this framework. Moral anti-realism leaves room for relativist moral systems, but in our example we're going to ignore 
this possibility. I could write a long article about why having this belief is rational but I'll leave that for another time.

### Kant's categorical imperative
The categorical imperative is the idea that in order for an action to be ethical a society would still have to function if said action were to be commit by everyone.
For example by this standard skipping a vote is not ethical, as if no-one were to vote society would not function.

## Types of morality
I believe that fundamentally there are two types of morality and they are almost always intertwined, in fact one often results as product of the other.

### Emotional morality
The first type is emotional morality, some things simply feel wrong. There are obviously many reasons for this:
 
* Empathy: This is Schopenhauer's view that morality is entirely derived from empathy
* Societal conditioning: a society says that people being naked in public is immoral
* New is bad: the insular cortex is the section of the brain responsible for producing disgust reactions, if someone is not socialised around some
phenomena whilst they are young their insular cortex can produce this reaction when they see something new. For instance a person is brought up in a 
totally heterosexual society, they see a gay couple and the reaction triggers. People conflate this reaction with a sense of moral justice.

### Emotional Rational morality
First of all there is a type of emotional morality that masquerades as rationality morality, people have an emotional position, they do not realise it
and then they reverse engineer a argument. To be fair these arguments are generally on rational terms, but as they already have a conclusion, the 
argument cannot be seen as a rational argument. For example if I were to believe that Finland did not exist for religious reasons, and I produced an argument 
on rational terms:

* I have never met a finnish person
* Once I booked a flight to Finland and it was cancelled

These points may be anecdotal and weak but they are at least rational, I am not just saying "I don't feel like Finland exists". But the thing is, I am only saying
these things because I emotionally hold the opinion that Finland doesn't exist, so anything I use to rationalise that point is, in my mind, absolutely irrational.

### Rational morality
Now we're onto the good stuff, the philosophers descend down from from their dogma free mind-void and mathematically derive perfectly ethical behaviour. Of course I'm exaggerating
but there are systems out there are abstract enough that I believe they can be considered generally rational and not so emotional for example the aforementioned categorical 
imperative. These ideas will still contain a lot of bias, as every idea does, but as far as humans go I believe these tier of ideas are rational that one can use them against their 
emotional desires.


## Let's get to the good shit
Right so personally I am a moral anti-realist, however I also have empathy, so the basis of what I will and will not do is entirely dependent on my emotions.
This can be seen as quite worrying as if I had a brain injury which damaged wherever my empathy comes from, I would essentially act in complete self interest.
Doing everything I possible could to further my own happiness even at the expense of others. 

So lets create a 10 million humans with exactly this view 
Let's create some societies. 

__Society A__
* No laws 
* Everyone is a moral anti-realist
* Everyone has high levels of empathy

__Society ∀__
 * No laws
 * Everyone is a sociopath
 * Everyone is smart
 * Everyone is aware of the prior facts.
 * Everyone likes to murder
 * But everyone loves to live in a functioning society 
 * Everyone lives and breathes Kant, they just can't get enough of him. It's kinda unbearable to be honest.
 * Everyone rationally holds the position of the categorical imperative

Society A & ∀ both have the same number of people & access to the same resources.

Maybe you disagree with me but I believe that both societies will function perfectly fine, in fact I believe that society A functions worse than society ∀.
 
### Game Theory in Society ∀

Well I think we need to get into some game theory to figure out why I think society ∀ can work.

So in the [Prisoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma), even though we see both actions have the same 
[expected value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) in terms of years in prison, people generally lean to the idea that it is better to try to betray your 
partner. There's actually a British gameshow based on this called _Golden Balls_ and it's just horrible to watch. Regardless you could cite 
the prisoner's dilemma and say: "If people have an inclination to betray, why would sociopaths of all people not betray their comrades in society ∀?".
This is exactly where the categorical imperative comes in, the sociopaths know that no one in the society has empathy & so I claim that people will
 not murder each other, despite their desire to and the lack of legal consequences. 
 
Well why the hell not? I believe these individuals will all come to 
the same conclusion, that even if they were sure they could get murder in private, if they follow the logic of the imperative
then the society would break down. They all know that everyone else in the society has these desires and they know everyone would be secretly 
murdering each other, and then the society would break down. More specifically everyone gets murder in the society except one person, in fact I 
made a little program to simulate the phenomena.

So a society full of sociopaths will be free of murder, despite their emotional desire all thanks to intellectual rationality. 

### How does Society A function?
Society A would not function as a capitalist democracy, people do not feel sympathy for corporations and would relentless steal for them as there are not consequences. I speculate if we're to oversimplify 
the situation that society A could function as a barter economy. There would be a kind of natural equilibrium in this society, whenever someone noticably amasses too much wealth,
they either begin to give away their resources to the needy (as they feel guilty, they have high empathy). 
Or alternatively others begin to steal from said person, as they do not feel guilty from stealing from someone with excessive wealth. 

So why do I believe that society ∀ functions "better" than society A, what does better even mean. The criteria I'm using is how the societies 
adapt to hard times, almost any system can function to some extent when a society has an abundance of resources.

## How do the societies deal with different scenarios?

### Scenario 1 - Scarce resources
