## The philosophy behind the hypotheticals
If you're already familiar with moral anti-realism & Kant's categorical imperative please skip ahead, one of my worst nightmares is mansplaining philosophy.

### Moral anti-realism
Moral anti-realism is the belief that objective morality does not exist, nothing is objectively good or objectively evil. Even things society regards as abhorrent such 
as mass murder, are not wrong or evil objectively in this framework. Moral anti-realism leaves room for relativist moral systems, but in our example we're going to ignore 
this possibility. I could write a long article about why having this belief is rational but I'll leave that for another time.

### Kant's categorical imperative
The categorical imperative is the idea that in order for an action to be ethical a society would still have to function if said action were to be commit by everyone.
For example by this standard skipping a vote is not ethical, as if no-one were to vote society would not function.

## Types of morality
I believe that fundamentally there are two types of morality and they are almost always intertwined, in fact one often results as product of the other.


### Emotional morality
The first type is emotional morality, some things simply feel wrong. There are obviously many reasons for this:
 
* Empathy: This is Schopenhauer's view that morality is entirely derived from empathy
* Societal conditioning: a society says that people being naked in public is immoral
* New is bad: the insular cortex is the section of the brain responsible for producing disgust reactions, if someone is not socialised around some
phenomena whilst they are young their insular cortex can produce this reaction when they see something new. For instance a person is brought up in a 
totally heterosexual society, they see a gay couple and the reaction triggers. People conflate this reaction with a sense of moral justice.

### Rational morality
Rational morality sounds perfect, some morals are based on flaky human emotions (gross) but finally the high-iq philosopher kings have come in to save the day,
providing objective morals. Well not quite. It turns out that people are very emotional and
