People close to me should be painfully aware that there are a number of key
concepts that govern my behaviour & goals. I explain these ideas a lot, fortunately
I have a number of very smart and well read people in my life so many of the ideas (determinism,
 moral, anti-realism, etc)
are already familiar to them which is just great. But there are also many weird unintuitive
_Greg_ ideas that I can't really expect anyone to get without an adequately _Greg-like_ explanation.
 
I hope to formulate these ideas here, for the peace of mind of myself and anyone
unfortunate enough to have to listen to me.
